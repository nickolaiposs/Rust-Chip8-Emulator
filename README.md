# Rust Chip8 Emulator

A Chip8 Emulator made in Rust. This project runs .ch8 files made for the Chip-8 programming language. This is a beginner project in both Rust and emulation, and I intend to pursue more Rust systems programming projects in the future.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, run the command:

> cargo run "filepath/game.ch8"

where "filepath/game.ch8" is the filepath to the .ch8 file.

## To-do List

- Include a sound engine
- Improve the event-handling system
- Fix various bugs pertaining to executing opcodes
